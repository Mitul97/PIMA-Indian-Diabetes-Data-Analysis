# PIMA-Indian-Diabetes-Data-Analysis

## Background

Diabetes Mellitus is affecting 382 million people around the world. Hence, there is increase in the number of people with type 2 diabetes worldwide. Only in United states of America, approximately 30.3 million people were identified as suffering from diabetes and 1.5 million Americans are being diagnosed with diabetes each year. The population studied was the PIMA Indian tribe women population near Phoenix, Arizona, United States. The tribe has been under continuous study since 1965 by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases due to it’s high incidence and prediabetes rate of diabetes.
Since in women pregnancy seems to be a factor. According to World Health Organization Criteria, which stated that “if the 2-hour post-load glucose was at least 200 mg/dl at any survey exam or if the Indian Health Service Hospital serving the community found a glucose concentration of at least 200 mg/dl during routine medical care”. Given the data about PIMA, we will be trying to make predictions on how likely a PIMA Indian women is to suffer from diabetes, and therefore, act appropriately towards it. We can start analyzing statistical data that will help us study the onset of diabetes in Pima Indian women.

## Features
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2).

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: iabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history).

Age: No explanation needed.

## Steps

- Data Cleaning
- Checking Normality of Data (QQ-Plots, Cullen and Frey Graph)
- Converting the distribution of fields to Normal Distribution
- Data Visualization (Joint density plot and joint boxplot)
- Hypothesis Testing (Paired t-test)
- Correlation Heat map
- Logistic Regression Model to Predict Diabetes
