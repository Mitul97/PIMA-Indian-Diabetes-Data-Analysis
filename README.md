## Background

What is diabetes?
"Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy."

Type 1: If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.
Type 2: If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.
Gestational diabetes: Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2 diabetes.

Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Features
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2).

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: iabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history).

Age: No explanation needed.

## Steps

- Data Cleaning
- Checking Normality of Data (QQ-Plots, Cullen and Frey Graph)
- Converting the distribution of fields to Normal Distribution
- Data Visualization (Joint density plot and joint boxplot)
- Hypothesis Testing (Paired t-test)
- Coorelation Heat map
- Logistic Regression Model to Predict Diabetes
