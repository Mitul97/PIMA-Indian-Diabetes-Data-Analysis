## Background

What is diabetes?
"Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy."

Type 1: If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.
Type 2: If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.
Gestational diabetes: Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if youâ€™ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2 diabetes.

Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Features
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2).

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: iabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history).

Age: No explanation needed.

## Steps

- Data Cleaning
- Checking Normality of Data (QQ-Plots, Cullen and Frey Graph)
- Converting the distribution of fields to Normal Distribution
- Data Visualization (Joint density plot and joint boxplot)
- Hypothesis Testing (Paired t-test)
- Correlation Heat map
- Logistic Regression Model to Predict Diabetes
